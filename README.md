__**The Traitor Mode**__

> Evil Factory's Traitor Mod is a server-sided mod that overrides the vanilla traitor mode. If a round starts with enough players, some crew members may be selected as traitor and receive new objectives to prevent the rest of the crew from achieving their mission. The traitors are selected by a weight system, assuring that players who have not been traitors so often will be more likely to be chosen. 
> Captains and Security Officers are always loyal to the ship and need to work together to find and restrain all traitors so the crew can complete their mission.

__**The Points System**__

> Whenever a player gains a skill point, he also gains an amount of points. Traitors gain additional points by completing their objectives. Non-Traitor crew gains points by completing their missions and reaching the end of the level. 
> Points will be persistently stored on the server and accumulate over rounds. If a player dies a number of times the amount of points will be reduced. Players can gain lives back by completing their missions.
> On every round half of a player's points will be given the character as experience and can be used to pick talents.

__**Traitor objectives**__

> **Main objectives** - one of these will always be chosen
> 
> • *Assassination*     (700 points per target) 
> Traitors will receive a target crew member to kill. Once the target is killed a new victim will be selected from all alive crew members. Every crew member can only be targeted once. If there are no new targets left, the traitor wins.

> **Sub objectives** - up to three of these may be chosen and can be done optionally to gain more points 
> 
> • *Kidnapping*        (4500 points)
> Put a selected security guard in handcuffs for a given time.
> 
> • *Poison Captain*    (1500 points)
> Inject the acting captain with poison. This is only available for medic traitors
> 
> • *Steal Captain ID*  (1500 points)
> Take the ID card from your acting captain and put it in your inventory.
> 
> • *Survive*                  (500 points, +1 Life)
> Finish at least one main objective and be alive at the end of the round. Can be set to be always active.
 
__**Events**__

> There is a chance that a random event fires some time during the round.
> • *Super Ballast Flora*
> Several ballast tanks will be infested with alien plants.
> 
> • *Communications Offline*
> Will drastically reduce the range of all remote communication for the whole round.
